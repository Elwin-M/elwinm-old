                                    This website and the server it's hosted on is an amalgamation of everything I've ever learned in regards to IT. <br />
                                    The start of my full-stack developer journey. It is completely built from scratch and every bit of it is hand coded by me. <br />
                                    The web server is hosted on a server running Apache. It features SSL encryption, automated certificate renewal, <br />
                                    dynamic DNS so that there is minimal downtime, as well as Cloudflare CDN and caching services. <br />
                                    It is also reactive so no matter what display or device you are using, you will have a pleasant experience. <br /><br />

                                    Unfortunately most of the work is done behind the scenes so it is not directly visible to the end user, so I have to try and detail it here. <br />
                                    Most of the code for the website is also available on my
                                    <a href="https://github.com/Project-Guardian" target="_blank">GitHub</a> if you are interested. <br />
                                    However, parts of it are not due to privacy and security reasons (i.e. SQL connection forms, and certain server files). <br /><br />

                                    Other features of my servers are: htaccess configurations, automatic redirects (including
                                    <a href="https://elwinm.ca/404.html" target="_blank">error 4XX</a>),<br />
                                    <a href="https://games.elwinm.ca" target="_blank">game servers</a>
                                    (Minecraft, Terraria, one-off spin ups), other subdomains, reverse proxy services for public network facing devices, <br />
                                    an OpenVPN connection for remote access, Samba network shares, and virtual hosts for running other servers (
                                    <a href="https://plex.elwinm.ca" target="_blank">Plex</a>, OctoPrint, and PiHole). <br /><br />

                                    I also host my families public servers utilizing virtual hosts, but those can not be shared due to privacy reasons. <br /><br />

                                    This server was my first foray into the Linux environment and I have amassed a great amount of knowledge in terms of <br />
                                    but not limited to, design, developement (full-stack and otherwise), system administration/ management (users, CRON, group policy), <br />
                                    network management (DHCP, CDN, DNS), backup management, and best security practices. <br /><br />

                                    Cloudflare services are also used to hide sensitive data from bots and crawlers, as well as their proxy and firewall services. <br />
                                    Once again, while a majority of my experiences have been detailed here, it is by no means all of it. <br />
                                    Several hundred hours of designing, developement, troubleshooting, and general labour have been put into all of this.

                                    This was created as a volunteer project for my local church to: <br />
                                    Give back to my community and to expand my own knowledge. Everything was created by me from scratch. <br />
                                    I actively work on the website to make changes as per the requirements of the members and maintain it as necessary. <br /><br />

                                    This webpage is displayed in a kiosk style environment at the church (also set up and managed by me as needed). <br />
                                    It features a sleek and responsive page. There are three carasouls, one is for the rotating images, the second <br />
                                    is for the information display (Birthdays, Wedding Anniversaries, and Sponsors), and the third is for the News section at the bottom. <br /><br />

                                    The images, information display, and news all get their content via a connection to a MySQL database. <br />
                                    I also created an admin panel so that the administrative members can access it to add or edit the data. <br />
                                    The sponsors data is updated weekly before the Mass so it is vital that the website retrieves the newest data as soon as possible. <br /><br />

                                    The admin panel features a login using properly encrypted users in a database with hashed and salted values. <br />
                                    While there was originally a sign-up page created which featured the ability for anyone to create an account, <br />
                                    it was not necessary as the website is not open to the public. So it was later removed. <br />
                                    Cookies are used that time out automatically so that the user is not logged in permanently (security reasons). <br />
                                    It features a simple interface so that anyone of varying ages will have no trouble using it. <br /><br />

                                    One of the major challenges I encountered when building this website was retrieving the accurate dates as the requirements<br />
                                    of the church was to use dates starting from Sunday to Saturday, where MySQL functions retrieve it as Monday to Sunday. <br />
                                    I had to create my own functions for this specific need as there were no alternatives (at least at the time). <br /><br />

                                    For the admin panel, I have created a guest user that connects to a mock database that can showcase the abilities of the main one. <br />
                                    However as is was not meant for production, it is not entirely polished and not fully functional <br />
                                    (i.e. changes made are not visible anywhere else but the admin panel). It is still able to display what the real one can do. <br />
                                    While this goes against all proper security practises, I believe in an isolated environment, this will be okay, <br />
                                    the username and password are both "guest" Please use this account if you are interested in seeing the admin panel.

                                    This page was purely created as a joke. It features an embedded YouTube video of a timer countdown, <br />
                                    and a button that lets you stop the JavaScript function that will activate at the end of the video running in the background <br />
                                    that will automatically redirect the page to Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up <br />

                                    A simple program created for my personal use.<br />
                                    It was made so that I can convert all my local music files into a JSON format so that I can upload the list<br />
                                    to a website and have it import all the songs onto a YouTube or Spotify (amongst others) playlist.<br /><br />

                                    It originally started out as a simple python script,<br />
                                    but I decided to make a GUI so that I can share it with others who are not as versed in Python and programming/ scripting.

                                    Python script that uses the (old) Twitter API to read tweets from an account,<br />
                                    and then uses the OpenAI (Chat GTP) API to classify the tweets.<br /><br />

                                    In this specific script, it determines if tweets from the specific account contains sales promotions in the forms of “deals”<br /><br />

                                    This was a simple script to showcase my ability to use different API’s.

                                    This collaboration project was created for Toronto Hacks 2022.<br />
                                    It is used to calculate CO2 emissions for users based on data provided by the user.<br />
                                    It can be used to plot the data on a graph so that the user can keep track of it all.<br />
                                    It can also be used compare with other users.<br /><br />

                                    This project was completed in 24 hours.<br />
                                    We had to overcome many challenges and it was a first-time experience for many of us.<br />

                                    This project is a relatively new upgrade to my server setup. It runs on enterprise hardware.<br />
                                    Some highlights on this project are the use of ACL’s, ZFS, Snapshots, Docker Containers,<br />
                                    Reverse Proxy with Traefik, VPN Management, DNS Management, and SSL Encryption/ Renewal Policies.<br /><br />

                                    It is an overall  upgrade to my previous server in almost everyway, from capacity to performance and security.<br />
                                    It also features GUI management and network shares only allowed by LAN and VPN managed clients.<br /><br />

                                    Furthermore, it extends and improves the capabilities of my old server by integrating Dynamic DNS services better<br />
                                    as well as integrating with Cloudflare and Let’s Encrypt in a more professional manner.<br />
                                    It also features automation in regard to updating components as required.<br /><br />

                                    This server is used in conjunction with my old ones to improve reliability and service.

                                    As a passion project, I have begun development on a video game in the Unity engine.<br />
                                    It is still in early stages and there is no minimum viable product to show,<br />
                                    but I have gained valuable experience in planning, designing, and programming in regard to video games and it's development.<br /><br />

                                    It is a top-down isometric game with a pixel art style. The game uses C# and it is a cooperative project.
